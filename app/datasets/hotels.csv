Carried away from the city on the whimsy of the decor, the mind is free to pursue pleasure amid a fantasy setting conjured through artwork, sofas, causeuses, and divans.

Hotel Brighton - Esprit de France,"218 rue de Rivoli 01 Arr., 75001 Paris France","2,308 reviews",4.5,"""An unique view in the heart of Paris"" The Hôtel Brighton, built on Rue de Rivoli by Lord Egerton at the beginning of the 19th century, became one of the capital’s leading hotels, attracting many British customers. This district of Paris, which is now the 1st arrondissement, was very popular with British clients on The Grand Tour, an initiatory trip across Europe and sometimes as far as Asia with the aim of completing the artistic and cultural education of the young middle classes. The hotel has preserved a large number of antique elements down the years, beginning with the period mosaic with the words ""Hôtel Brighton"" on the ground beneath the arcades of Rue de Rivoli in front of the hotel. Inside, the marble columns in the hall, the sculpted high reliefs in the bar, the set of antique mirrors and the many French windows, the tall ceilings on the ""noble floors"" and the exposed beams in the rooms on the upper storeys all bear witness to the history of the site and the people who gave it its charm. But what makes the Hôtel Brighton a truly exceptional place is the breathtaking 180° panorama. To the left, the Louvre, once a royal palace, today a museum, the Tuileries Gardens opposite and the Place de la Concorde to the right with the Eiffel Tower in the background. One of your best memories of Paris will be this unique view.",4,"Paid public parking nearby|Free High Speed Internet (WiFi)|Bar / lounge|Bicycle rental|Kids stay free|Babysitting|Pets Allowed ( Dog / Pet Friendly )|Airport transportation|Parking|Wifi|Coffee shop|Breakfast available|Breakfast buffet|Breakfast in the room|Complimentary instant cofffee|Complimentary tea|Books, DVDs, music for children|Highchairs available|Taxi service|Salon|Baggage storage|Concierge|Newspaper|Non-smoking hotel|24-hour front desk|Dry cleaning|Laundry service",Blackout curtains|Soundproof rooms|Air conditioning|Desk|Housekeeping|Coffee / tea maker|Flatscreen TV|Bath / shower|Bathrobes|Interconnected rooms available|Private balcony|Room service|Safe|Sofa|Telephone|VIP room facilities|Wardrobe / closet|Bottled water|Clothes rack|Iron|Laptop safe|Private bathrooms|Wake-up service / alarm clock|Minibar|Electric kettle|Complimentary toiletries|Hair dryer,Non-smoking rooms|Suites|Family rooms,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/6b/cb/d4/hotel-brighton-esprit.jpg?w=900&h=-1&s=1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d233725-Reviews-Hotel_Brighton_Esprit_de_France-Paris_Ile_de_France.html

The team is local and will take you to meet some of the places, people and stories that bring Pigalle alive and make Paris so vibrant. The croissants are provided by the nearby bakery, the books selected by the local bookstore and the music chosen by a neighbourhood DJ who also is an album collector and happens to be born in Pigalle.

The waiters paid absolutely no attention to us whatsoever, they never came to ask if we wanted more, or if the cocktail was good.   The final and most terrible mistake was that they did NOT even know the name of their cocktails, we told them that there was a mistake on the bill (they were the ones losing money, not us) and they laughed at our faces, treated terribly and made fun of us, they entire bar staff teamed up against us and started correcting us.

Hotel du Rond-Point des Champs-Elysees - Esprit de France,"10 rue de Ponthieu, 75008 Paris France",231 reviews,5.0,"""A unique Art Deco setting"" “Go through the entrance to the early 20th century with its elegant Art Deco canopy overhead and take up residence close to the main sights of Paris.” The Hotel du Rond-Point des Champs-Élysées has belonged to the family of Mrs Villette-Vuitton since the late 19th century. Esprit de France’s recent refurbishments pay tribute to all the original 1920 features, from the Art Deco canopy and marble elements outside to the wine bottle glassware and the tin radiator covers within. The hotel name, “Le Rond Point” (roundabout) evokes an abundancy of styles and genres inciting difference and travel. Refurbishing encompassed carefully selecting each decor to create a poetic, bohemian-chic universe with a hint of nostalgia, as well hunting down antiques to pair with the modern furniture to create a visual and timeless contrast. The result is a delightful feeling of peacefulness, as if time had stopped. The basement now houses a 13-metre pool, which offers the luxury to swim in an art deco setting. The breakfast room and the bar will transport you between a cozy alcove and a multiplied mirrors’ game.",4,"Paid private parking nearby|Free High Speed Internet (WiFi)|Pool|Bar / lounge|Kids stay free|Books, DVDs, music for children|Airport transportation|Business Center with Internet Access|Parking|Wifi|Indoor pool|Breakfast available|Breakfast in the room|Complimentary instant cofffee|Children's television networks|Highchairs available|Taxi service|Conference facilities|Meeting rooms|Photo copier / fax In business center|Hammam|24-hour security|Baggage storage|Concierge|Newspaper|Non-smoking hotel|24-hour check-in|24-hour front desk|Dry cleaning|Laundry service|Ironing service|Shoeshine",Blackout curtains|Soundproof rooms|Air conditioning|Desk|Housekeeping|Coffee / tea maker|Flatscreen TV|Bath / shower|Bathrobes|Interconnected rooms available|Private balcony|Room service|Safe|Seating area|Separate living room|Sofa|Telephone|VIP room facilities|Wardrobe / closet|Bottled water|Clothes rack|Iron|Laptop safe|Private bathrooms|Wake-up service / alarm clock|Minibar|Electric kettle|Complimentary toiletries|Hair dryer,City view|Bridal suite|Non-smoking rooms|Suites|Family rooms,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/1b/6b/ca/9b/hotel-du-rond-point-des.jpg?w=900&h=-1&s=1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d236567-Reviews-Hotel_du_Rond_Point_des_Champs_Elysees_Esprit_de_France-Paris_Ile_de_France.html

Bordered by the remains of city walls and a tower called the white tower, the plots became peasant gardens. A century later, in 1886 - under the protection of a gentleman benefactor of the Abbey of Saint-Nicolas - a Castle was born. The Benedictine nuns began hosting families opened a school for girls of the abbey. The round tower and the square pavilion, pepper-pot roofs and four slopes, false battlements and tall chimneys, windows and doors decorated with braces, are a harmonious example of architectural style of Viollet-Le-Duc. The mansion was an inspiration for the architect to draw on the exceptional tower houses that have adorned the town of Verneuil since the fifteenth century. In gothic style, the walls come alive with color. The ""checkerboard"", so characteristic of the region, combines the dark brick called ""flamed"" orange brick and whitewashed plaster, while flints and brick diamonds offer subtle variations in the tone. The sisters welcome families into the 1960s. In 1961, it was renamed the Hostellerie du Clos. In 2007 it became Le Clos. The castle original will require ongoing renovations, modernization and decoration but will preserve its original spirit. In the spring of 2015 will rise to a former conservatory Gustave Eiffel style of 100 sqm, facing south with a view overlooking the park. It will host the breakfasts, a restaurant that showcases the ""Bistronomie"" tea room, reading and rest ... A relaxation area with a swimming pool cover, bio sauna, bio steam room, fitness , energy showers ... Finally a south-facing terrace on the ground floor equipped with sun and a beautiful place ""nose in the grass"" to eat more lightly. Today, the castle of fifteen rooms and suites located in a park of ancient trees has beautiful botanicals, beautiful and loyal birds, four hives with bees pollinate flowers and tree gardens.

At the reception the host was unable to communicate in English so it was difficult to get information about the accommodations and to ask questions.   We were surprised that we were further charged 10€ a day for parking, this is outrageous at the price we were paying and should be included in the rate.  We also took the semi-inclusive meal plan and after reading about the different restaurants on the site wanted to try them out, only to find out that we could only use the meal plan at one restaurant.  Lastly at the beginning of September, while the weather is still great, half of the pools and water attractions are closed.    Lastly on the cleanliness and safety of villa we rented.  There were open wires and broken floor tiles on the stairs.  Not a safe environment at all for young children.

Chateau Clement,"Chemin de la Chataigneraie, 07600 Vals-les-Bains France",211 reviews,5.0,"Sometimes you stay somewhere that it is impossible to fault and Chateau Clement is one of those places.  Firstly, I would like to thank our host (and the hotel's owner) Marie-Antoinette who could not have been more friendly and helpful.  She and her staff made our stay fantastic and very memorable.  Now onto the accommodation: the interior of this  family-run chateau is  simply breath-taking, with beautiful, ornately carved wooden staircases and wood panelling. We stayed there for three nights, two nights in the 'modern' part of the chateau on the ground floor and one night in a two bedroom suite on the first floor.  The modern suite, still part of the chateau itself,  is large and has been beautifully renovated. (see photos). There is a big bathroom with a jacuzzi bath and  spacious separate shower room.  Tea and coffee making facilities are also provided and there is also a fridge.  The room  leads straight out into the grounds of the hotel which is ideal if you have a dog/children.  For the third night, we had our son and his girlfriend joining us so we moved up into the two bedroomed suite on the first floor.  These rooms are in the stunning, and more traditional part of the chateau (see photos) but also very homely and comfortable, in fact, it's impossible not to feel part of the family when you stay there.  Breakfast, which was included in the price, was very good too with a generous selection of fresh French pastries, traditional cheeses, ham and local bread, as well as cereals and yoghurts.  It is worth mentioning that the hotel is not always able to provide dinner, however, the town which is a five/ten minute stroll away through the grounds has some very good restaurants indeed.  Can't wait to return!…",,Free parking|Free High Speed Internet (WiFi)|Pool|Free breakfast|Hiking|Pets Allowed ( Dog / Pet Friendly )|Spa|Non-smoking hotel|Wifi|Indoor pool|Outdoor pool|Heated pool,Flatscreen TV,Non-smoking rooms|Suites|Family rooms,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/97/22/16/filename-clement-jpg.jpg?w=900&h=-1&s=1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g196717-d664523-Reviews-Chateau_Clement-Vals_les_Bains_Ardeche_Auvergne_Rhone_Alpes.html

However, a « refuge » can also be an area where we feel safe, at ease, far from daily troubles…a refuge is a shelter, a cocoon, an oasis in the centre of the desert, or why not a temple on the very top of the mountain, a room with a view out over the horizon ? The experience offered by hotel Pashmina is a simple one : exclusive luxury in a mountain resort.",5,Free High Speed Internet (WiFi)|Pool|Fitness Center with Gym / Workout Room|Bar / lounge|Skiing|Babysitting|Free shuttle or taxi services|Meeting rooms|Wifi|Hot tub|Indoor pool|Heated pool|Fitness / spa locker rooms|Sauna|Restaurant|Breakfast available|Breakfast buffet|Airport transportation|Shuttle bus service|Spa|Couples massage|Facial treatments|Foot massage|Massage|Ski In / Ski Out|Concierge|Dry cleaning|Laundry service,Air conditioning|Private balcony|Room service|Safe|Minibar|Flatscreen TV,Non-smoking rooms|Suites|Family rooms,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/12/6d/bb/ef/photo1jpg.jpg?w=900&h=-1&s=1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g196716-d7885733-Reviews-Hotel_Pashmina-Val_Thorens_Saint_Martin_de_Belleville_Les_Belleville_Savoie_Auvergne_R.html
